					"The second element is useful when you have to add a product that doesn't have a barcode, like 'lösgodis' for example. In that situation, click on the 'No Barcode' button. The 'No Barcode' section should appear and you can now enter the different values. You have 3 values to enter here: the category of the product (Alimentation, Magazine or Décoration/Alcool), the quantity and the price (Note that all 3 values are required, you won't be able to add a product if you missed one value). To enter the numeric values, you have to use the numeric keypad at your disposal. When you are done, you can simply click on the 'Add Product' button and the product will be added to the cart.",
